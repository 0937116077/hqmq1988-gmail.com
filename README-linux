Strace has been ported by Branko Lankester <branko@hacktic.nl>
to run on Linux systems.  Since then it has been greatly modified
by various other people.

If you want to compile strace on a Linux system please make sure
that you use very recent kernel headers. Strace needs those to get
the proper data structures used by the kernel, since these can be
different from the structures that the C library uses. Currently
you will need a 2.2.7 or newer kernel.

To compile strace using your kernel source you need to tell make where
you put the sources. For example if you have your kernelsource in
/usr/src/linux, you should invoke make like this:

     make CFLAGS=-I/usr/src/linux/include

Please note that it is possible to symlink /usr/include/{asm,linux,scsi}
to your kernel source, but for programs that don't need the actual kernel
structures that is highly discouraged.
