To use mpers functionality, one should:
* typedef all of the target types which are compound and not typedefed
already;
* for each target type, include DEF_MPERS_TYPE(target_type_t), these can
be included conditionally;
* include MPERS_DEFS once;
* before inclusion of MPERS_DEFS include all important headers
(containing definitions of these types or other behaviour-affecting
defines);
* printers should be defined
as MPERS_PRINTER_DECL(return type, function name)(args) and called
as MPERS_PRINTER_NAME(function name)(args).
